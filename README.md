# GenZMultiplicationFlashcards - An intro


The purpose of this project is to create a modern-day flash card program that will be used by students learning multiplication.
Education for Gen Z is moving away from traditional flashcards and toward electronic means. 
We want to help improve their options by creating this program.

## The software will
* allow personal greetings to the learner 

* have input options

* describe the amount of answers correct and incorrect

* provide the time it took the student to complete

* ending message of congratulatory upon completion
